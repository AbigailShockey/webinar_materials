# Introduction to R part I: Simple mathematics

### R can be used to perform mathematical equations.
### Addition is performed using + :

2 + 2

### Subtraction is performed using - :

4 - 2

### Multiplication can be performed using * :

2 * 2

### Exponents can be calculated using ** or ^:

2**2
2^2

### R can also be used for mathematical comparisons.
### Equal to:

2 == 2
  
### Greater-than/less-than:

4 > 3

### Greater-than or equal to/less-than or equal to:

4 >= 2

2 <= 4

### Not equal to:

3 != 2

### When a comparison is true, R returns TRUE, and when a comparison is false, 
### R returns FALSE
### This statement would return FALSE:

2 > 3

### And this statement would return TRUE:

3 > 2
